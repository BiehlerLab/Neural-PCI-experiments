## Introduction

This repository is the PyTorch implementation for **NeuralPCI**.  

NeuralPCI is an end-to-end 4D spatio-temporal Neural field for 3D Point Cloud Interpolation, which implicitly integrates multi-frame information to handle nonlinear large
motions for both indoor and outdoor scenarios.

## Changelog  
<!-- 2023-3-27: We released the code of NeuralPCI. -->  
2023-2-27: This paper is accepted by **CVPR 2023** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
